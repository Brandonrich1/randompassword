# randompassword
This is a password generator for my class challege using javascript.
It was designed to solve the problem of coming up with a new secure password.
The user can use the webpage to select just how secure they want their password to be.
Selecting if they want Caps, lowercase, spcial characters, and numbers.
Selecting "Okay" will add that specific attribute to your generated password 
Selecting "Cancle" gives the user the option of not having said attribute apart of their password.
 

 I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and this here readME for the contents of this repo.
